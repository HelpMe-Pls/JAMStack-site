# Introduction

This project would not have been possible without the guidance of [Zachary Reece](https://www.udemy.com/user/zacharyreece/) and his dedicated support throughout the process.
The project is intended to demonstrate what I've learnt about React, Gatsby, Material UI and serves as a component for my resume.

# Introduction

This project would not have been possible without the guidance of [Zachary Reece](https://www.udemy.com/user/zacharyreece/) and his dedicated support throughout the process.
The project is intended to demonstrate what I've learnt about [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and serves as a component for my resume.

## Usage

You can have have a look and play around with the UI by visiting the [live demo](https://locostore.netlify.app/) 

If you want to try out the fully functional version of the project, please follow the instructions in the [backend](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/JAMStack-site/blob/master/backend/README.md) and [frontend](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/JAMStack-site/blob/master/frontend/README.md) folders respectively.


I do want to deploy the project with all of its functionality, but that requires maintaining the [AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) to keep the backend running, which exceeds the Free Tier's limit so... long story short, I'll have to pay for service to keep it working, which, you know, as a fresh graduate, it's out of my financial capability.

## Installation
If you prefer using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), I suggest `v1.22.17`. The latest version `berry` doesn't seem to work after the installation step.
1. `cd backend`
2. `npm i` or `yarn`
3. [Contact me](https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/100005341874318) if you get this far, I'll send you the `.env` file to run the project.
4. `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
    The Strapi server should be accessible at `localhost:1337/admin`, again, [contact me](https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/100005341874318) if you want to get the credentials for the testing Admin account.
5. Proceed with the instructions in the [frontend](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/JAMStack-site/blob/master/frontend/README.md) folder.
